## Day 1 Questions

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
* puts "Hello World!"
1. What is the character you would use to indicate comments in a ruby file?
* The octothorpe, or hashtag, #
1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
* Integers are full numbers, like 1, where as floats have a decimal, like 1.5. 1.0 is also a float, because of the 'floating point'
1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
* animal = "zebra"
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
* puts animal
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
* puts "A knock off horse is called a #{animal}."
1. How do we get input from a user? What is the method that we would use?
* `gets`, and then using .chomp to remove their 'return key' from the string entry
1. Name and describe two common string methods.
* There's also `print`, which displays a string without a `newline` character. the `.split` method allows you to take a string and separate it based on either the base argument of ` ` or on your own argument. It will then turn that single string into an array of strings.
