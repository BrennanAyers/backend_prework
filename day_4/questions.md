## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
 * Methods are used for code that will be reused throughout your program. It will reduce the need for redundant typing or copying and pasting of code.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
 * def hello
 * * p "Sam I am"
 * end
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
 * def hello_someone(name)
 * * p "#{name} I am"
 * end
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
 * You would just need to type `hello_someone(George)` and it would print "George I am"
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
 * What is the verdict on optional parentheses? Will we be expected to use parentheses in class in our work? Or will we be expected to NOT use them?
